Goal: A way to quickly sketch and manipulate shapes to create diagrams.

Consists of shapes. Each:

* Can be created by drawing (using the perceptron or detector)
* Can be styled:
	-Stroked
	-Filled
* Can be rotated
	- Each shape has a "true north," unlike Adobe Illustrator
* Can be scaled
* Can maintain 0 or more endpoints with Connectors
* Can have text
* Can be selected (either alone or as part of a collection of selected shapes)
* Can be deleted

Connectors:

* Have two end points, each of which may (optionally) be linked to a shape. If linked, then the endpoint will move when the attached shape moves.
* May have mid points and curves
* Can be styled via strokes.


Things we need:
* The ability to convert a drawn shape into a Shape object or a Connector.
	- Detector.js or perceptron.js
* The ability to automatically "snap" Connectors to Shapes, if the endpoint of the Connector coincides with the shape.
	- Requires the ability to test whether a given point lies within a region.
* The ability to select Shapes via a rectangular region
* The ability to click on Shapes to select them
* The ability to unlink Connectors from Shapes
* The ability to add text to Shapes/Connectors
* The ability to move Shapes and have their linked Connectors move with them.
