JS library needs:

-- new DOM element, the `Pen mark' (really a svg drawing)
  -- 9 times of Pen marks -- 4 lines, closed path

-- new DOM element -- 'super text' (can be a link)

These two elements need:
-- drag/drop 
-- arbitrary click to add

4 mouse events:
click, click and drag, double click, double click and drag

Need to record pen marks as they are made, classify them, and smooth them

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to handle positioning of elements elements smartly:
  isAbove: check if the element is above this element (within a specified range)
  isBelow: check if the element is below this element (within a specified range)
  isLeft: check if the element is to the left of this element (within a specified range)
  isRight: check if the element is the left of this element (within a specified range)
  isInside: check if the element is inside this element
  isSurrounding: check if the element (partially) surrounds this element
  split: split this element according that element (for closed path this is equivalent to a partitioning, for lines this is equivalent to splitting the element into where the line is, and where the line isn't) 
  whereBelow: return the range of pixels where the element is below
  whereAbove: return the range of pixels where the element is above
  whereRight: return the range of pixels where the element is to the right
  whereLeft: return the range of pixels where the element is to the left
  whereInside: return the range of pixels where the element is inside
  whereSurrounding: return the range of pixels where the element (partially) surrounds this element

1) make the double click vs single click smarter
2) make double-drag-and-drop
3) make single-drag-and-pen
